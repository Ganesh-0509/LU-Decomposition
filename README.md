# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import the numpy module, scipy module to use the built-in functions for calculations.
2. Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array().
3. Using the Built-in functions such as lu(), lu_factor(), lu_solve() find the L, U, LU decomposition of the matrix
4. End the program


## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
```

RegisterNumber: 24900911

PROGRAM:

import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import lu
A = np.array(eval(input()))
P, L, U = lu(A)
print(L)
print(U)

RegisterNumber: 24900911

PROGRAM:

import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import lu_factor, lu_solve
A = np.array(eval(input()))
b = np.array(eval(input()))
lu, piv = lu_factor(A)
x = lu_solve((lu,piv),b)
print(x)

```

## Output:
